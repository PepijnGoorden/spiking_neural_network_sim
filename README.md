# Spiking Neural Network Simulation
### A visual simulation tool designed for the exploration and analysis of spiking neural networks (SNNs).

Users can create custom networks of neurons and connections, enabling experimentation with various training methods and topologies. The tool provides real-time visualization of neural spiking activity. 

Note: Future updates will likely include methods for immediate observation of parameter adjustments, customization of neuron and synapse properties, basic learning algorithms.

Key features include neuron and connection creation with an intuitive interface for network construction and modification. This tool serves as a practical resource for neural network, machine learning, and AI enthusiasts, promoting active engagement and deeper understanding of SNNs and Liquid Neural Networks.
